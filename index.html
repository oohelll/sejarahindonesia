                    <h1>Early History</h1>
                    <h1>Republic Of Indonesia</h1>

                    <p>Fossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the "Java Man", suggest the Indonesian
                        archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago. Homo sapiens reached the
                        region around 43,000 BCE. Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population,
                        migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000
                        BCE
                        and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they spread east. Ideal
                        agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth
                        century BCE allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE. The
                        archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade,
                        including
                        with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties, from several centuries BCE. Trade has since
                        fundamentally shaped Indonesian history</p>

                    <p>From the seventh century CE, the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade and the
                        influences
                        of Hinduism and Buddhism. Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE, the agricultural
                        Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving
                        grand
                        religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu Majapahit
                        kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its
                        influence
                        stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a "Golden Age"
                        in
                        Indonesian history.</p>

                    <h1>Colonial Era</h1>

                    <p>The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco
                        Serr√£o, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku
                        Islands. Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East
                        India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was
                        dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as
                        a nationalised colony.</p>

                    <p>
                        For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces
                        were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions both on and off Java. The influence of local
                        leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in
                        Maluku, and the bloody 30-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military
                        forces. Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to
                        become Indonesia's current boundaries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule
                        and encouraged the previously suppressed independence movement. Two days after the surrender
                        of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, influential nationalist leaders, proclaimed
                        Indonesian independence and were appointed president and vice-president, respectively.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle
                        ended in December 1949 when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence in the face of
                        international pressure and transferred sovereignty to the United States of
                        Indonesia. Despite extraordinary political, social and sectarian divisions,
                        Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.

                    <p>
                        As president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained
                        power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly
                        powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Tensions between the military and the PKI
                        culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by
                        instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million
                        people. The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.
                        Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with
                        Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968. His "New Order" administration,
                        supported by the United States, encouraged foreign direct investment, which
                        was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It brought out
                        popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and
                        ultimately ended Suharto's presidency. In 1999, East Timor seceded from
                        Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia and a 25-year occupation marked by
                        international condemnation of human rights abuses.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and
                        instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004. Political, economic
                        and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism (the deadliest being the 2002
                        Bali bombings) remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly in
                        the last 15 years. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute
                        sectarian discontent and violence remain a problem in some areas. A political settlement
                        to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 following the 2004 Indian Ocean
                        earthquake and tsunami that killed 130,000 Indonesians</p>
